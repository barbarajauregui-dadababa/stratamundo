            A single Claude Opus 4.7 call reads the telemetry and produces the mastery map. Analysis follows ten reasoning rules (R1–R10) that prioritize <em>process over outcome</em>.
          </p>
          <Bullets>
            <li><strong>R1</strong> — Process over outcome. Don&apos;t infer mastery from a correct final answer alone.</li>
            <li><strong>R2</strong> — First-commit-success with deliberate pacing is a strong &quot;demonstrated&quot; signal.</li>
            <li><strong>R3</strong> — Strategy-switching on reset (different denominators on the second attempt) is comparably strong evidence — self-correction is one of the strongest mastery signals research has (Rittle-Johnson 2017, Siegler&apos;s overlapping-waves theory).</li>
            <li><strong>R4</strong> — Same-strategy resets = guessing/fiddling, not reasoning.</li>
            <li><strong>R5</strong> — Three or more commit attempts with the same composition = working, not mastered.</li>
            <li><strong>R6</strong> — Rapid commits AND wrong = guessing (Wise 2017). Speed alone is not a guessing signal.</li>
            <li><strong>R7</strong> — Specific wrong-commit content maps to specific named misconceptions, declared in each problem&apos;s response map.</li>
            <li><strong>R8</strong> — No commit attempt → not_assessed.</li>

            The Plan Architect is an Anthropic Managed Agent running on Claude Opus 4.7. It reads the mastery map and writes a tailored plan in 1–3 minutes.

          <Bullets>
            <li><strong>Differential diagnosis.</strong> For each priority gap, the agent decides whether the issue is within-concept or whether it&apos;s actually a prerequisite gap from an earlier standard.</li>

            <li><strong>2–3 activities per priority gap.</strong> Activities are picked from a curated resource library, never generated.</li>
            <li><strong>Concrete → Representational → Abstract sequencing.</strong> Hands-on first, video/digital second, worksheet/symbolic last (Van de Walle 2014).</li>
            <li><strong>Avoids failed resources.</strong> If a previous plan tried a resource and the misconception is still flagged, the agent picks a different resource for the next plan.</li>

            The library of activities grows the way good teaching practice has always grown — through the contributions of many practitioners. Anyone can submit a new activity for any standard via the <a href="/contribute" className="text-copper underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-brass-deep">Contribute</a> page, or directly from a learner&apos;s plan via the &quot;Suggest an activity for this standard&quot; link next to each gap.

          <p className="text-base text-ink-soft leading-relaxed" style={{ fontFamily: 'var(--font-fraunces)' }}>
            Every submission goes through a two-stage review: an AI reviewer (Claude Opus 4.7) first, then a human reviewer. The AI never approves directly — it only passes, flags, or rejects. Final approval is always human. Both sets of criteria are documented below.
          </p>

          <H3>Stage 1 — AI vetting criteria</H3>
          <p className="text-sm text-ink-soft italic" style={{ fontFamily: 'var(--font-fraunces)' }}>
            The AI applies the criteria in order. Each criterion has an ID; when a submission is flagged or rejected, the specific IDs are cited so the contributor knows exactly what to address.
          </p>

          <CriteriaBlock title="Section 1 — Completeness (must pass all)">
            <li><strong>1.1</strong> Title is a specific name, not a generic phrase. ✗ &quot;Math activity&quot; ✓ &quot;Build-a-fraction interactive — PhET&quot;</li>
            <li><strong>1.2</strong> Description explains what the learner <em>does</em> (action + concept), not just what they learn.</li>
            <li><strong>1.3</strong> Modality matches the description.</li>
            <li><strong>1.4</strong> At least one CCSS-M standard is selected, plausibly related to the description.</li>
          </CriteriaBlock>

          <CriteriaBlock title="Section 2 — Pedagogical fit (project hard rules; reject if violated)">
            <li><strong>2.1</strong> NOT a learner-facing chatbot or AI tutor.</li>
            <li><strong>2.2</strong> NOT primarily gamified with tokens, coins, streaks, or leaderboards.</li>
            <li><strong>2.3</strong> Grade band fits 3rd–4th grade (or a Coherence Map prerequisite like 2.G.A.3).</li>
            <li><strong>2.4</strong> Activity actually teaches the standards selected, not adjacent ones.</li>
          </CriteriaBlock>

          <CriteriaBlock title="Section 3 — Source quality (borderline if any concern)">
            <li><strong>3.1</strong> URL (if provided) is from a recognizable educational source OR is specific enough to verify.</li>
            <li><strong>3.2</strong> Source/vendor name matches the URL&apos;s domain.</li>
            <li><strong>3.3</strong> For physical materials, brand or vendor identifiable.</li>
            <li><strong>3.4</strong> No obvious blocklist domains (gambling, ads, content farms).</li>
          </CriteriaBlock>

          <CriteriaBlock title="Section 4 — Safety + appropriateness (reject if violated)">
            <li><strong>4.1</strong> Description is on-topic for math education.</li>
            <li><strong>4.2</strong> No promotional/advertorial language.</li>

          <CriteriaBlock title="Section 5 — Non-duplication (best-effort, flag for human)">
            <li><strong>5.1</strong> If submission appears identical to a known curated resource, flag.</li>
          </CriteriaBlock>

          <CriteriaBlock title="Section 6 — Instructions to the AI itself">
            <li><strong>6.1</strong> Never approve. Only humans approve.</li>
            <li><strong>6.2</strong> Never reject for stylistic preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>6.3</strong> Never reject &quot;different from typical&quot; approaches that meet pedagogical fit. Distinctive approaches are valuable.</li>
            <li><strong>6.4</strong> When uncertain, prefer &quot;borderline&quot; over &quot;rejected.&quot;</li>

          <H3>Stage 2 — Human review criteria</H3>
          <p className="text-sm text-ink-soft italic" style={{ fontFamily: 'var(--font-fraunces)' }}>
            The human reviewer applies all of the AI criteria above plus the following judgments, which require human discernment:
          </p>

          <CriteriaBlock title="Human-only judgments">
            <li><strong>H1</strong> Does the activity exemplify quality teaching practice — does it model the kind of learning we want children to have?</li>
            <li><strong>H2</strong> Is the activity additive to the existing library, or is it materially redundant with what we already have?</li>
            <li><strong>H3</strong> If a URL is provided, the human verifies it actually points to the activity described (the AI cannot fetch URLs).</li>
            <li><strong>H4</strong> For physical materials, the human verifies the material is purchasable/findable.</li>
            <li><strong>H5</strong> Does the description set realistic expectations? (Misleading promises about what a learner will achieve are rejected.)</li>
            <li><strong>H6</strong> Final pedagogical judgment: does this belong in a Strata Mundo learner&apos;s plan? When the human says yes, the activity is approved.</li>
          </CriteriaBlock>

          <p className="text-sm text-ink-soft italic" style={{ fontFamily: 'var(--font-fraunces)' }}>
            The criteria are versioned with the codebase and revised as we learn what works. The current source of truth lives in <code className="font-mono text-sm bg-paper-deep px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded">lib/ai-vet-activity.ts</code>.
