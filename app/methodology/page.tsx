            A single Claude Opus 4.7 call reads the telemetry and produces the mastery map. Analysis follows ten reasoning rules (R1–R10) that prioritize <em>process over outcome</em>.
          </p>
          <Bullets>
            <li><strong>R1</strong> — Process over outcome. Don&apos;t infer mastery from a correct final answer alone.</li>
            <li><strong>R2</strong> — First-commit-success with deliberate pacing is a strong &quot;demonstrated&quot; signal.</li>
            <li><strong>R3</strong> — Strategy-switching on reset (different denominators on the second attempt) is comparably strong evidence — self-correction is one of the strongest mastery signals research has (Rittle-Johnson 2017, Siegler&apos;s overlapping-waves theory).</li>
            <li><strong>R4</strong> — Same-strategy resets = guessing/fiddling, not reasoning.</li>
            <li><strong>R5</strong> — Three or more commit attempts with the same composition = working, not mastered.</li>
            <li><strong>R6</strong> — Rapid commits AND wrong = guessing (Wise 2017). Speed alone is not a guessing signal.</li>
            <li><strong>R7</strong> — Specific wrong-commit content maps to specific named misconceptions, declared in each problem&apos;s response map.</li>
            <li><strong>R8</strong> — No commit attempt → not_assessed.</li>
            <li><strong>R9</strong> — Evidence in data, not narrative. Use plain language for guides; problem IDs go in audit fields, not in prose.</li>
            <li><strong>R10</strong> — &quot;Mastered&quot; requires success across multiple problems for a standard, with clear reasoning.</li>

            The Plan Architect is an Anthropic Managed Agent running on Claude Opus 4.7. It reads the mastery map and writes a guide-facing plan in 1–3 minutes.
          </p>
          <Bullets>
            <li><strong>Differential diagnosis.</strong> For each priority gap, the agent decides whether the issue is within-concept or whether it&apos;s actually a prerequisite gap from an earlier standard.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart-skip.</strong> The agent identifies the FIRST IM Section containing any flagged standard and starts there. Earlier sections where everything is mastered or untouched are marked accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>2–3 activities per priority gap.</strong> Activities are picked from a curated resource library, never generated.</li>
            <li><strong>Concrete → Representational → Abstract sequencing.</strong> Hands-on first, video/digital second, worksheet/symbolic last (Van de Walle 2014).</li>
            <li><strong>Avoids failed resources.</strong> If a previous plan tried a resource and the misconception is still flagged, the agent picks a different resource for the next plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Plain-language rationale.</strong> Every activity gets a 1–2 sentence explanation of why it&apos;s prescribed for this learner&apos;s specific misconception.</li>

            <li>The plan prescribes activities for the flagged standards.</li>
            <li>After the learner does the activities, the guide runs a <strong>focused probe</strong> on one standard — ~4–6 problems, ~10 minutes — to verify the misconception has resolved.</li>
            <li>If resolved → the standard moves to <em>Mastered</em> in the parent mastery map.</li>
            <li>If not resolved → the Plan Architect re-plans with options: same activities + more time, different modality, or escalate to a prerequisite.</li>
            <li>This <em>loop</em> is what distinguishes a diagnostic of current misconception from proof of mastery. Mastery is earned through the loop over time, not claimed from a single assessment.</li>

            <li><strong>Strategy-switching on reset is positive evidence of mastery.</strong> A learner who tries one approach, gaps, resets, and tries another successfully is demonstrating self-correction — one of the strongest mastery signals research has (Rittle-Johnson 2017, Siegler&apos;s overlapping-waves theory).</li>

            <li><strong>No percentage scores.</strong> Categorical states only. Percentages collapse different mastery realities (fluent guessing, slow reasoning, partial understanding) into one number that hides the diagnosis.</li>
            <li><strong>No gamification.</strong> No XP, streaks, leaderboards, badges, or extrinsic rewards. Mastery-based settings reject these mechanics; we honor that.</li>
            <li><strong>No gated progression.</strong> The system suggests; the guide decides. Mastery is declared by the guide, supported by the evidence we surface.</li>
